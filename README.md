# Single-Phase-H-Bridge-Three-Level-Inverter
In this project, implementation of single phase 3 level H-bridge inverter is done for controlled conversion of different voltage level of DC into respected AC voltages.
Available conventional inverters have several disadvantages such as complex structures, cost, higher number of components and low efficiency. 
Here inverter uses a microcontroller, octo-couplers, soft switching using MOSFETS and Power quality is also measured using DSO of generated AC signal.
